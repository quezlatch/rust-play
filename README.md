# rust-play
Rust mess about kind of thingy

## Set out stall

Big idea is to try out using rust to do a full stack website as opposed to the more normal
embedded/systems type examples...

As an extra, going cloud first...

**seed** or **yew**? picked seed for no particular reason...

## Tooling

[Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/)
[Trunk](https://trunkrs.dev)
[Cargo workspaces](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch14-03-cargo-workspaces.html)

## Steps

* create cargo workspaces
* create website from seed quickstart
* expose port and setup
* start website on start with `cargo make ...`
* a bit more gitpod configuring
